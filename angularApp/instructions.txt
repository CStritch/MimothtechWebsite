## commands that were used to set-up angular##

node --version ##needs to be greater than version 18
npm install -g @angular/cli  ##installs the latest version of angular (assumes NPM is installed)

## starter files were required to create the basic application##
## in the same directory as the application files extracted...##
npm install ng serve

## there may be audit issues, remember to do the following command if required##
npm audit fix


ng serve ##start server to run app. ctrl+c to stop
ng generate component housingLocation --standalone --inline-template --skip-tests ## creates a component .ts and .css files
ng generate interface housinglocation ## creates an interface ?? What does this mean, you ask?

## a docker image was made to avoid requring an npm install for every instance of created function ##

## ----- Depreciated information ----- ##
## when copying from one location to another (i.e. pull) ##
## Need to do the following commands:
## npm install
## npm install -g json-server
## ng serve (starts up application at http://localhost:4200)


## json-server --watch db.json (starts up server to read json file at http://localhose:3000)

## Good luck! This is the basic angular tutorial completed with customisations.
